Atif: Hey Rony, I think you already have “file 1”: it’s the “As-Built” schedule in Oracle Primavera .xer format for a completed Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) called “D1 project” built by one of our clients, CLP. We would please like to run this file through the latest Clustering algorithms and UI you have kindly been working on and explore the results. It would be also good to compare “file 1" with “file 2”. File 2 is the latest available schedule for the “D2 project” also being built by CLP. “D2 project” is also a CCGT plant and its about half-way finished. We would like to generate some recommendations for the clients based on the clustering algorithm.
